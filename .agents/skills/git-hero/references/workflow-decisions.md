# Workflow Decisions

Decision matrices for choosing workflows, branching strategies, and merge vs rebase.

## Merge vs Rebase Decision Matrix

| Scenario                               | Use                           | Why                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Syncing your branch with upstream      | `git pull --rebase`           | Keeps your commits on top, avoids noise merge commits |
| Landing feature into main              | `git merge --no-ff`           | Preserves feature boundary as a merge commit          |
| Shared branch (others have pulled it)  | `git merge`                   | Never rewrite shared history                          |
| Cleaning up local commits before PR    | `git rebase -i`               | Squash fixups, reword messages, reorder               |
| Undoing a merged feature               | `git revert -m 1 <merge-sha>` | Safe undo without rewriting history                   |
| Updating a long-lived branch (develop) | `git merge`                   | Rebase would rewrite too many shared commits          |

### The Golden Rule

> **Never rebase commits that exist outside your local repository.**

If you've pushed and someone else may have pulled, treat that history as immutable. Use merge or revert.

## Workflow Comparison

### Trunk-Based Development

```
main ─────●────●────●────●────●────
           \  /      \  /
            ●         ●
         (short-lived branches, < 1 day)
```

**Best for:** Small teams (1-3), continuous deployment, high trust.

**Rules:**

- Branch from main, merge back within hours (1 day max)
- Feature flags for incomplete work
- No long-lived branches
- CI/CD on every push to main

**Pros:** Minimal merge conflicts, fast feedback, simple mental model.
**Cons:** Requires solid CI/CD, feature flags add complexity, risky without good test coverage.

### GitHub Flow

```
main ────●────●─────────●────●────
          \              /
           ●────●────●──
            (feature branch + PR)
```

**Best for:** Teams of 3-10, frequent releases, code review culture.

**Rules:**

- Main is always deployable
- Branch for every change (feature, fix, chore)
- Open PR for review before merging
- Deploy from main after merge

**Pros:** Simple, enforces review, works well with CI/CD.
**Cons:** No release staging, main can break if CI is weak.

### GitFlow

```
main    ────●──────────────────●────
             \                /
develop ──●───●───●───●───●──●──────
           \     / \     /
            ●──●    ●──●
          (feature) (feature)
              \
               ● (release branch)
```

**Best for:** Large teams (10+), scheduled releases, multiple versions in production.

**Rules:**

- `main` — production-ready only, tagged releases
- `develop` — integration branch for next release
- `feature/*` — branch from develop, merge back to develop
- `release/*` — branch from develop for release prep, merge to both main and develop
- `hotfix/*` — branch from main for urgent fixes, merge to both main and develop

**Pros:** Clear release process, parallel development, hotfix isolation.
**Cons:** Complex, many long-lived branches, merge overhead.

### Ship / Show / Ask

```
main ──●───●──────●────●─────●────
        \         PR    PR (merge
      (Ship,   (Show, merge  waits for
      no PR)   immediately)  feedback = Ask)
```

**Best for:** High-trust teams (any size) who want PR-based feedback without a mandatory approval gate blocking every merge.

**Rules:**

- Ship — commit directly to mainline, no PR, no review wait (established patterns, unremarkable fixes)
- Show — open a PR, merge immediately once checks pass, feedback happens after the fact
- Ask — open a PR and wait for feedback before merging (genuine uncertainty, experiments)
- Author decides the mode per change and merges their own PR
- Short-lived branches, rebased on mainline often; feature toggles keep mainline releasable

**Pros:** CI speed + PR feedback culture, no approval-queue bottleneck, avoids rubber-stamp reviews.
**Cons:** Needs real team trust and feature-flag discipline; not suited to regulated/mandatory-review environments.

## Branch Naming Conventions

```
<type>/<ticket-or-slug>
```

| Prefix     | Purpose               | Example                  |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `feature/` | New functionality     | `feature/oauth-login`    |
| `fix/`     | Bug fix               | `fix/cart-double-submit` |
| `hotfix/`  | Urgent production fix | `hotfix/payment-timeout` |
| `release/` | Release preparation   | `release/2.1.0`          |
| `chore/`   | Maintenance, tooling  | `chore/upgrade-eslint`   |

## Branch Lifecycle Checklist

1. **Create** — branch from the right base (`main` or `develop`)
2. **Name** — use `<type>/<slug>` convention (`feature/oauth-login`)
3. **Work** — atomic commits, rebase to sync with upstream
4. **Review** — open PR, get approval
5. **Merge** — `--no-ff` to preserve branch history
6. **Delete** — immediately after merge (both local and remote)

```bash
# After merge, clean up
git branch -d feature/oauth-login            # delete local
git push origin --delete feature/oauth-login  # delete remote
```

## When to Squash

| Situation                                | Strategy                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature branch with clean atomic commits | Merge as-is (`--no-ff`)                            |
| Feature branch with messy WIP commits    | Squash into 1-3 logical commits before merging     |
| Single-commit fix                        | Fast-forward or `--no-ff` (team preference)        |
| Large refactor with meaningful stages    | Keep individual commits, rebase to clean up fixups |

**Squash workflow:**

```bash
git rebase -i main        # mark commits as 'squash' or 'fixup'
# Edit the combined message
git push --force-with-lease --force-if-includes origin <branch>
```
